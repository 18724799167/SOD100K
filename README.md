# SOD100K
The official repo of the ECCV 2020 paper [Highly Efficient Salient Object Detection with 100K Parameters](http://mftp.mmcheng.net/Papers/20EccvSal100k.pdf).
# CSNet
CSNet is now released.

# CSF + Res2Net
`Cross Stage Fusion (CSF) part + Res2Net` is in the `CSF+Res2Net` subfolder.
CSF can be integrated into ImageNet pre-trained large models such as Res2Net to achieve SOTA performance with less parameters.
